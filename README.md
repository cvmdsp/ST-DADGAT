EEG Cross-subject Emotion Recognition Based on Domain Adaptive and Dynamic Graph Attention Temporal and Spatial Hybrid Network
**<p align="center">Abstract</p>**
Emotion recognition based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a pivotal role in human–computer interaction. Nevertheless, traditional neural networks encounter difficulties in extracting detailed emotional features from EEG signals. Moreover, a significant number of current methods overlook the spatial topological connections between EEG electrodes and the temporal interdependencies within the signal context. In light of this, this study proposes an EEG driven spatio-temporal hybrid network based on domain adaptation and dynamic graph attention (ST-DADGAT) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. ST-DADGAT effectively models the spatial topological correlations of EEG channels, the long-range dependencies of EEG temporal signals, and frequency relationships. Initially, the study employs a multi-scale residual convolutional learning (MRCL) module to capture the frequency relationships of EEG data. Subsequently, a temporal self-attention representation learning (TSRL) module is utilized to acquire global contextual information of the EEG data. Finally, the features are fused and input into a dynamic graph attention network (DGAT) to obtain comprehensive channel spatial topological correlation information. In addition, a domain adaptation loss based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is incorporated before the classifier to minimize the domain discrepancies between the source and target domains. This method helps mitigate the influence of inter-subject variability on cross-subject emotion recognition. Finally, to evaluate the proposed algorithm, cross-subject emotion recognition experiments are conducted on the SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets, achieving accuracies of 84.68 %, 74.97 %, and 26.56 %, respectively. The outstanding experimental results confirm the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating its potential for practical applications in the field of emotion recognition based on the analyzed datasets.
